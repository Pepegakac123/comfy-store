# Comfy Store

The Comfy Store project presents a sample online shop specializing in home decorations, featuring a streamlined interface without an extensive backend. Users can easily add products to their cart and filter items based on various criteria.

The store was designed and implemented using JavaScript, React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI. The interface is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless user experience. With dynamic product filtering and the ability to choose from multiple color options, the Comfy Store offers a user-friendly shopping experience while handling asynchronous data interactions efficiently with TanStack Query.
